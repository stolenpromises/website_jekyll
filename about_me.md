<h2>Profesional interests</h2>
<p>I worked in manufacturing automation at a small startup.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about optimization and process improvement'.</p>
<p>I rose through the ranks, built a team and got a fair bit of leadership experiance.</p>
<p>I enjoy all things computer science. Lately I've been spending a fair bit of time solving interesting problems in #python and learning throughout that process. Manipulating data and running monte carlo simulations has led me to #tableau in order to better visualize project/simulation findings. Most recently, I spent about 10 years building a family business in the #manufacturing #automation space. My background is in #economics, #leadership, #business and all things #computation.</p>
